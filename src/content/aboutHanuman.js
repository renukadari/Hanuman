    "HCAHP1" : "Lord Hanuman, a revered deity in Hinduism, finds his origins deeply embedded in ancient Indian scriptures, most notably the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. His life and exploits are chronicled in various texts, providing a profound understanding of his significance in Hindu mythology.",
    "HCAHP2" : "In the Valmiki Ramayana, one of the oldest and most authoritative versions of the Ramayana, Lord Hanuman is introduced as the son of Anjana and Kesari, bestowed with divine blessings. His birth is marked by celestial events, and from an early age, it becomes evident that he is no ordinary being. As a child, Hanuman, curious and mischievous, once mistook the sun for a ripe mango and attempted to devour it. This act angered the gods, who cursed him with temporary amnesia of his divine powers until he was reminded of them later in life.",
    "HCAHP3" : "Hanuman's pivotal role unfolds in the epic Ramayana, where he becomes a devoted disciple of Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu. His devotion is exemplified by the pivotal role he plays in the search for Sita, Rama's kidnapped wife. Hanuman's fearless leap across the ocean to reach the island of Lanka, where Sita is held captive, is a testament to his unwavering commitment.",
    "HCAHP4" : "The Hanuman Chalisa, a devotional hymn composed by Tulsidas in the 16th century, is another significant scripture that encapsulates the essence of Lord Hanuman's divine attributes. Comprising forty verses, the Chalisa narrates the glories of Hanuman, emphasizing his strength, humility, and devotion to Lord Rama.",
    "HCAHP5" : "In the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic, Hanuman is also present in a less conspicuous form. It is believed that he assumed a miniature size to reside within the flag of Arjuna's chariot during the Kurukshetra War, symbolizing his continued service and allegiance to the divine cause.",
    "HCAHP6" : "Lord Hanuman's character transcends the pages of scripture, extending into various regional texts, folklore, and cultural narratives across India. His stories convey profound moral and spiritual lessons, inspiring devotees to cultivate virtues such as unwavering faith, courage, and selfless service.",
